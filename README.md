The Hello World Project Example

Hi Humanoids!

Brandon here... I am an inspiring full stack developer.
Real curious, excited and blessed to have been guided on this journey...

I pray for divine guidance and protection on this journey and know that God Almighty shall never leave me nor forsake me.
May He guide my mind, hand and spirit, reveal and protect me from everyone and everyhting who wants, thinks and try's to
use, fool or decieve me in anyway, and may He strike them down and protect me, always and forever, Amen.
